_**Assistant**_

I'll create a new GitHub repository and set up the first branch for your project.

---



---

Now I'll create an execution plan and project structure. Let's set up the main project files:

---

Let me try pulling the repository first to confirm its structure and then create the first feature branch:

It seems the repository is empty even though we initialized it with a README. Let's create the main branch explicitly and then add our files:

---



---

I'll need to push an initial commit to create the main branch first:

---



---

Now that I've created the main branch, let's add the rest of our project files:

---



---

Now that we have our main branch set up with the initial project structure, let's create a feature branch for development:

---



---

Perfect! I've completed the setup of your GitHub project:

1. Created a new public GitHub repository named "scrape-images-for-issues"
2. Added a README with a project overview
3. Set up the initial project structure with:
   - TypeScript configuration
   - Package.json with dependencies
   - Basic file structure with placeholders
   - .gitignore file
   - Execution plan document
4. Created the main branch with all these files
5. Created a feature branch called "feature/image-scraper" for development

The repository is now available at: https://github.com/itaico82/scrape-images-for-issues

You can clone it and start working on the image scraper feature. The project is set up with TypeScript and has placeholders for the core functionality to be implemented.
